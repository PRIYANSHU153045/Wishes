This website is built with a single HTML file and some assets (images/music), making it perfect for free static hosting.

Here are the best free options for you:

### Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest & Fastest)
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. Open your file explorer on your computer.
3. Drag and drop your entire `Bthday` folder into the Netlify box on the browser page.
4. Wait a few seconds, and it will give you a live link (e.g., `romantic-birthday-sneha.netlify.app`).
5. You can rename the site in "Site Settings" to something like `happy-birthday-sneha`.

### Option 2: GitHub Pages (Best for keeping code safe)
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
2. Create a new repository named `birthday-sneha` (or similar).
3. Upload your `index.html`, photos, and music files to the repository.
   - You can do this via the web interface "Upload files" button or `git` commands.
4. Once uploaded, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
5. Under "Branch", select `main` (or `master`) and click **Save**.
6. Wait a minute, and you will get a link like `yourusername.github.io/birthday-sneha`.

### Option 3: Vercel (Very pro)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up with GitHub/Email.
2. Install Vercel CLI (`npm i -g vercel`) OR simply drag and drop if they support it, but it's usually link-to-github based.
3. The easiest way with Vercel is to push your code to GitHub first (like Option 2), then "Import Project" in Vercel.

**Recommendation:**
Use **Netlify Drop** (Option 1). It takes literally 30 seconds and requires no account setup for the first deploy (though creating an account helps you keep the link permanently).

Good luck! She will love it. ❤️
